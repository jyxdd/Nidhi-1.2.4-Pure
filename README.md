## Introduction

[বাংলা (Bengali)](README-bn.md)

This repository is based on the `android16-aptusitu` branch of [SO-TS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250](https://github.com/SO-TS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250).

Code required for HyperOS/MIUI support, as well as some device-specific drivers, was selectively cherry-picked by comparing commit histories from [Strawing's repo](https://github.com/liyafe1997/kernel_xiaomi_sm8250_mod), which in turn sources changes from [UtsavBalar1231's repo](https://github.com/UtsavBalar1231/kernel_xiaomi_sm8250) and [Xiaomi_Kernel_OpenSource](https://github.com/MiCode/Xiaomi_Kernel_OpenSource).  

This kernel stands on the shoulders of giants, combining contributions from multiple upstreams to make it as practical and well-rounded as possible.

## Features

This kernel supports [sidex15's KernelSU-Next fork]() ([KernelSU-Next](), a fork of KernelSU ) & [SuSFS](https://gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu). Please install the [KernelSU-Next Manager]() by yourself.

The NoKernelSU version supports Magisk and APatch (and their forks).  

Below are some of the key features:  
1. Support for USB serial drivers (CH340 / FTDI / PL2303 / OTI6858 / TI / SPCP8X5 / QT2 / UPD78F0730 / CP210X)  
2. Support for CAN bus and USB CAN adapters (e.g. CANable)  
3. F2FS with realtime discard enabled for improved flash TRIM behavior  
4. Support for EROFS  
5. zRAM with support for multiple compression algorithms, including LZ4, LZ4HC, lz4k_oplus, LZ4KD, and ZSTD  
6. Backported BPF from Linux 5.10 (Android 16 compatible)  
7. Touchscreen, camera, audio, GPU/DRM/MSM, and CNSS2 drivers use Xiaomi-specific implementations (sourced from UtsavBalar1231's repository and MiCode. The AOSP version of the Display/DRM driver is LineageOS version.); also, `double_tap` node has been added to the touchscreen driver  
8. Fixes [the issue where the battery percentage gets stuck at 1%](https://github.com/liyafe1997/Xiaomi-fix-battery-one-percent), and supports recognizing higher-capacity replacement batteries
9. Integrate [BBG(Baseband-guard)](https://github.com/vc-teahouse/Baseband-guard)

## Notes

**Note**: The kernel zip package does **not** contain `dtbo.img` and will not flash your dtbo partition.  
It is recommended to use the stock `dtbo`, or one from the bundled files of a third-party ROM (if the original author confirms it works well).  
The `dtbo.img` built from this source has some issues—for example, on the lock screen, the display may suddenly flash to max brightness when trying to turn off the screen.  
If you have flashed other third-party kernels or encounter strange issues, please check whether your `dtbo` has been replaced.  

**Warning**: If you are using HyperOS/MIUI, please flash the **MIUI version**.  
The AOSP version has different display drivers, which will cause the screen not to display properly on HyperOS/MIUI.  
If you get a black screen after flashing, check if you are on HyperOS/MIUI but flashed the AOSP version.  
Feedback about this specific issue will not be accepted by default.
